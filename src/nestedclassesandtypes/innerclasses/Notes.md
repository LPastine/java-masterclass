# Inner Classes

Inner classes are non-static classes, declared on an enclosing class,
at the member level.

Inner classes can have any of the four valid access modifiers.

An inner class has access to instance members, including private
members, of the enclosing class.

**As of JDK16, static members of all types are supported on
inner classes.**
